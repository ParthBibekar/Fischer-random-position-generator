# Fischer-random-position-generator
Fischer random is a variant of chess in which the initial position of white pieces(not pawns) is randomly decided, in the first rank, following the two conditions:
1. The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.
2. The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.
(black pieces are kept similarly opposite to white)
There are 960 possible initial positions, this program generates of these 960 positions randomly.
The current(and the first!) official world champion in Fischer random chess is grandmaster Wesley So.
